# hello_world
My first Git repository

Hi!,
Today is 4th April 2020, we are Quarantined due to Corona Virus. I'm on my inplant training working from home.
So today I decided to Learn GitHub and this much commits made by me are by watching How to learn GitHub by GitHub itself.
I'm working at UtopiaTech this first commit was from DD.
